wrms-cli
========

Limited command-line interactions for Catalyst WRMS.

For now it just dumps the brief+status of a WR and all its descendants.

Unlike the Search page's `childof:` query, this doesn't restrict the results to "direct" descendants - children-of-children are also shown.
There isn't currently any filtering or sorting to speak of.
